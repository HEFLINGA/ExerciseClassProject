﻿# Class Project Step 9;## Auston Hefling#### (Updated) November 5, 2018# Exercise Assistance Application:## Functional: ### User Interface;	*UI1* The Application will have a window that displays different exercises (ref: EX1)	*UI2* Application will have a UI that displays chosen exercise (ref: UI2), and will show amount of weight you should be doing for that given exercise, based on the users ExerciseMax (ref: EXM1) they enter for 5 repetitions of that Exercise.	*UI3* Application will contain a window with the ability to enter a custom Exercise	*UI4* Application will have a window that contains all the details of the exercise that is selected (ref: INPUT6)	*UI5* Application will display plates needed for each exercise with the given repetitions and ExerciseMax applied (ref: PLATE1)	### User Input;	*INPUT1* The Application will take user's max for each exercise in Database (ref: EXM1, EXM2)	*INPUT2* The Application will take in user's custom Exercises if they choose to do so (ref: DB5)	*INPUT3* User will have the ability to select a certain exercise, and see the in-depth details of that exercise (ref: UI4)	*INPUT4* User will have option to change ExerciseMax for each Exercise (ref: INPUT2), even after it is set by 1 Cycle being complete (ref: CYCLE1)	### DataBase;	*DB1* The database will hold exercises to be used and displayed to the User (ref: UI4)	*DB2* Database will hold Custom exercises and all there information (ref: EX2 - EX7)		### Exercises;	*EX1* Application will contain default Exercises for User to access and use	*EX2* Application will take input for custom Exercises (ref: INPUT2)	*EX3* Exercises will have a Name field that is Visible to the User (ref: UI1)	*EX4* Exercises will have an ID field that is NOT visible to the User	*EX6* Exercises will have a Description of each exercise that is visible to the User (ref: UI4)	*EX7* Exercises will have the Max associated with them, based on what the User Inputs that will be visible to the User (ref: INPUT4, UI4)	*EX8* Exercises will have Math Associated with them based on User input 5 Repetitions (ref: MATH(ALL)), This will be displayed to the User for selected Exercise	*EX9* Exercises will have a scheme of 5 Repetitions, 5 Sets.  (ref: MATH1)	*EX10* Exercises will have a scheme of 8 Repetitions, 1 Set.  (ref: MATH3)	*EX11* Exercises will have a scheme of 3 Repetitions, 1 Set.  (ref: MATH4)	### ExerciseMax;	*EXM1* User will be able to enter there 5 Repetition Max for each given Exercise (ref: INPUT4)	*EXM2* User ExerciseMax (ref: INPUT4) will increase to weight of The 3 Repetitions 1 Set weight (ref: MATH4) every time 1 Cycle has been completed (ref: CYCLE5) and will be the new User ExerciseMax, but can be reverted if User chooses to (ref: INPUT7)		### Math for Exercises;	*MATH1* Math for 5 Repetitions weight, 5 Sets is as follows: 1st set = User entered 5 Repetition ExerciseMax weight. EACH following set (2-5) will have an additional 15% Decrease applied to them, Rounded to nearest 5lbs	*MATH2* Math for 8 Repetitions weight, 1 Set is as follows: Set = 3rd Set Weight (ref: MATH1)	*MATH3* Math for 3 Repetitions weight, 1 Set is as follows: Set = User ExerciseMax weight + additional 2.5% increase to weight	### Cycle;	*CYCLE1* 1 Cycle will consist of all exercises using the current 5 Repetition Max the user set	*CYCLE2* The user will have the ability to set that cycle (that 5 Repetition Max) as complete, and it will set the user max for that exercise in the db to the 1 x 3 Weight of that cycle.		### Plates;	*PLATES1* Application will calculate plates needed to == the weight for a given exercise (ref: MATH(ALL))		*PLATES1.1* Each Plate must be used twice to reach the weight (ref: PLATE1). If weight can't be used, Next plate in the hierarchy will be tried (ref: PLATE8). Process continues until target weight is reached	*PLATES2* Plate weight will use 45lbs as a plate	*PLATES3* Plate weight will use 25lbs as a plate	*PLATES4* Plate weight will use 10lbs as a plate	*PLATES5* Plate weight will use 5lbs as a plate	*PLATES6* Plate weight will use 2.5lbs as a plate	*Plates7* Calculating plates needed for weight of given Exercise and ExerciseMax will have a precedence hierarchy for which plates to use before trying to use other plates	*PLATES8* Plates Hierarchy is as follows: 45lbs > 25lbs > 10lbs > 5lbs > 2.5lbs. Application will try to use as few plates as possible in order to get to assigned weight (Using bigger plates first before smaller ones)
