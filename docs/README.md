# My Class Project; Exercising App

This is a course project for the successful completion of ISTA 220, 420, 322, 421, and 422 as part of the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, Fort Bragg Cohort 5 starting 8 AUG, 2018, ending 16 DEC, 2018.

 My project is an Exercise Application that will help Lifters in the gym achieve their goals faster, smarter and more effiecently.  This application is based heavily on Bill Starrs 5x5 exercise program, and is where I got all of the math I use for finding the 5 Rep for 5, 8 Rep for 1, and 3 Rep for 1 Weights on the "Calculations" page.
